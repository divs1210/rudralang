# rudralang

A general purpose functional programming language with familiar syntax.

Inspired from Clojure, Elixir.

Compiles to [Chez Scheme](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme) and to native via [chez-exe](https://github.com/gwatt/chez-exe).

Example factorial program:

```
ns!(fact,
  {} =>

  defn!(fact, {}, [n] =>
    cond(
      equal?(n, 0) => 1,
      :else        => mul(n, fact(sub(n, 1)))
    )
  )

  defn!(main!, {}, args =>
    println!(fact(5))
  )
)
```
